## Neural Network

Why neural network? a single neuron only permits a linear decision boundary and not real-world problems are complicated

## Deep learning model summary

- Neural network model: multi-layer perceptron, feedforward networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM): useful for modeling sequences (time series forecasting, sentence prediction)
- Convolutional Neural Networks: Useful for feature and object recognition in visual data (image, video). Also applied in other context (forecasting)
- Unsupervised Pre-trained Networks: Autoencoders, Deep Belief networks and Generative Adversarial networks. Used in generating images, labeling outcomes, dimensionality reduction

* Gradient descent
* Stochastic gradient descent
* Mini-batch gradient descent

In backpropagation, as we have more layers, the gradient gets very small at the early layers, this is known as the vanishing gradient problem. For this other activations such as ReLU have become more common.

# Activation functions

they improve our ability to determine non-linear outcomes
